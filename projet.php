                <p class="lead">Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that successfully reverse-engineers <a href="http://codepen.io/ThiagoFerreir4/full/eNMxEp" target="_blank">this <em class="fa fa-external-link"></em></a></p>
                <p><strong>Rule #1:</strong> Don't look at the example project's code on CodePen. Figure it out for yourself.</p>
                <p><strong>Rule #2:</strong> You may use whichever libraries or APIs you need.</p>
                <p><strong>Rule #3:</strong> Reverse engineer the example project's functionality, and also feel free to personalize it.</p>
                <p><strong>Hint:</strong> If you don't want to start from scratch, you can fork this simple Bootstrap portfolio template on <a href="http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/pen/mJNqQj" target="_blank">CodePen <em class="fa fa-external-link"></em></a></p>
                <p>Here are the user stories you must enable, and optional bonus user stories:</p>
                <p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a user, I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.</p>
                <p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a user, I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.</p>
                <p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a user, I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)</p>
                <p><strong>Bonus User Story:</strong> As a user, I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.</p>
                <p>Don't worry if you don't have anything to showcase on your portfolio yet - you will build several apps on the next few CodePen challenges, and can come back and update your portfolio later.</p>
                <p>There are many great portfolio templates out there, but for this challenge, you'll need to build a portfolio page yourself. Using Bootstrap will make this much easier for you.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Remember to use <mark><em>Read-Search-Ask</em></mark> if you get stuck.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>When you are finished, click the <strong>"I've completed this challenge"</strong> button and include a link to your CodePen. If you pair programmed, you should also include the Free Code Camp username of your pair.</p>
